                <p>Your address book is full of people who won't stay still. New jobs, new homes, and new social networks
                    make it difficult to keep track of it all. Online address book pulls it together automatically so your address book
                    is always up-to-date, accurate, and ready to go when and where you need it. Because change happens.</p>
